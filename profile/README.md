## Background
To achieve the vision of “Indonesia Emas 2045”, the nation must address critical issues like stunting. Stunting, as defined by the WHO (2020), refers to children who are significantly shorter than their peers for their age due to inadequate nutrition and recurrent infections during the first 1000 days of life. In Indonesia, the prevalence of stunting remains alarmingly high, with national rates at 24.4% according to 2021 SSGI data, and some provinces, such as East Nusa Tenggara, seeing rates as high as 37%. This poses a serious threat to the future of Indonesia, as stunted children face lifelong health and cognitive challenges. To combat this, we aim to create an Android application specifically designed to educate pregnant women and young mothers on the importance of proper nutrition to prevent children from being stunted. This app will provide tools for tracking nutritional intake and monitoring the growth and development of children, with a particular focus on the first 1000 days of life. The app includes a chat assistant feature that provides expectant mothers with basic knowledge about pregnancy, including tips on stunting prevention, nutrition, and other essential health information. By empowering mothers can create a healthy and balanced meal plan aligned with their body’s requirements during pre- and post-pregnancy, promoting their well-being and their baby’s optimal development, we hope to reduce stunting rates and improve overall child health in Indonesia, aligning with the nation’s long-term goals of achieving Indonesia Emas 2045.
